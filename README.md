#### StatusCheck README

If you're reading this, then it is safe to conclude that I have not forgotten to push up a README to this repo.

StatusCheck is a small project for the Litmus team, to demonstrate Rails skills or lack thereof. The idea is to provide an API which allows command-line updates via cURL, which will populate a list viewable in the browser.

This list will display the 'Status' of the theoretical LitmusApp, via binary `state` (UP/DOWN) and an associated `message`(i.e., 'We've been hacked!').

If sufficient progress is made in the next 3 hours, this README will also supply instructions for testing this project via the cURL library.
